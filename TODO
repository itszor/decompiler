TODO list for decompiler
========================

* Add missing instructions to decoder and insn_to_ir.

* Removal of stack save/restore code.

* Type tracking for (incoming) function parameters (outgoing ones are partly done).

* Extract types for declarations of local variables.

* Handle scopes/nested scopes properly (by matching to basic blocks?)

* Speed up symbol access/mapping symbols (add suitable indices). [partly done]

* Add parallel-set support for 'S' flag support etc.

* SP tracking falls over if it hits a phi node: fixable or not? Might suggest alloca or other dynamic stack allocation.

* Emission of types and data symbols.

* Add loading of debug info for dependent libraries.

* stm/ldm ordering broken? [fixed]

* I think we want exact address information during pointer tracking (to find the right locations in debug info). Maybe use "set_address" statements.
