TODO list for decompiler
========================

* Add missing instructions to decoder and insn_to_ir.

* Type tracking for (incoming) function parameters (outgoing ones are partly done). (Both are probably broken now!)

* Extract types for declarations of local variables.

* Handle scopes/nested scopes properly (by matching to basic blocks?)

* Speed up symbol access/mapping symbols (add suitable indices). [partly done]

* Add parallel-set support for 'S' flag support etc. (done -- no 'S' flag support yet though.)

* SP tracking falls over if it hits a phi node: fixable or not? Might suggest alloca or other dynamic stack allocation.

* Emission of types and data symbols.

* Add loading of debug info for dependent libraries.

* Use eabi.ml functions for incoming arguments as well as outgoing ones.

* Finish handling of stack accesses.

  - any unknown stack object which has its address taken will need to be invented, after determining an upper bound for its size. Any access falling within this region is then potentially a part of the same object.
